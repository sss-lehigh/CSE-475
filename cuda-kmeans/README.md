# CUDA KMEANS

This is example CUDA code that performs the Kmeans algorithm.
To run it give it the following parameters.

- f for filename
- c for the number of clusters
- t for the number of threads
- x for the algorithm

The algorithms are as follows:

Global Memory Centroid Threading 0
Global Memory Dimension Threading 1
Shared Memory Centroid Threading 2
Shared Memory Dimension Threading 3

The file format is:

number of object
number of attributes
whitespace seperated data
